This is a big problem. Publishing research proposals and then lashing out on Twitter when people criticize the proposals, is about as tone-deaf as you can get. I run multiple hundreds of validators. I am in a group with other people who each run multiple hundreds of validators--none of us believe the latest public proposals for issuance curve changes a) address the LST growth/concentration issue, or b) are in any way beneficial to solo stakers. EF credibility is on fire and people within EF and its orbit are pouring gasoline on it. From the churn cap being rushed into the HF before Dencun, based on absolutely ridiculous projections of 100% staked ETH by the end of 2024, to this latest issuance curve change spectacle, I think some self-reflection is desperately needed. If for nothing else, to stem the rapid loss of credibility. Lastly, the defensiveness and vilification of people with MASSIVE skin in the solo staking game, who may object to these proposals with rational objections, also needs to stop.

Maybe small penalty at first, and then slowly increase the penalty amout over time if the users stay attesting the wrong chain. 
Allow validators to (resync and) switch client to attest the right chain, even if they attested the wrong fork before, because they did not know there was a bug.

Otherwise it may cause a large amount of (solo) validators who are fervent supporters of the Ethereum network but made (honest) mistakes take huge losses, and even turn against the network later on. 

I believe most of the community members hate to see something similar to the ETC fork happen yet again. 

Also the percentage of different validators clients are only estimated. There should be a way to know the data more precisely, so that validators / pools can make better plans according to the data. "

Right now the ease of staking is quite low and the benefit is quite low.  This is bad.  Either they ease needs to be increased dramatically or the benefit needs to be increased or both.  I am hanging on by a thread now dealing with the hassle of staking at the current ho-hum levels of benefit, any reduction in benefit especially a significant one without a dramatic increase in the ease and I'm out.  (Of course a significant increase in the price of ETH would affect this calculus.)

I have written all my own scripts for handling staking and in theory I could re-stand a new rig in relatively short order if my current one died.  But, I haven't had time to research and I am loathe to deal with yet another unknown in setting up MEV.

I have no idea if the security settings of my setup are sufficient.  And it stresses me out not having isolation from the network that my family uses for their daily online usage.

The absolute worst was the setting of the withdrawal address.  That process removed at least two years from my life because of the stress of that event.  Had I known I would have to go through that, that single event alone would have probably have convinced me not to stake.

If I had a month (or more) to dedicate to this project I would:
   - move from linux to macOS which would require rewriting all my scripts
   - set up MEV
   - set up a separate internet connection for staking alone
   - setup separate execution and consensus devices
   - move from Geth to Nethermind (right now Geth runs out of space in about 2-3 months, which is a major pita)

There is no way I can deal with all that if the rewards get reduced.  The only affect I see from the current proposals is that I stop staking and move my ETH to cold storage or Coinbase.

It is clearly difficult to incentivize home-stakers while disincentivizing exchanges.  Limiting staking seems like an important goal, but obviously it is difficult to do that.  The only thing I can think of is a taxicab like medallions system with a secondary market for trading medallions.  Distributing them initially to current stakers.

And while that will solve the too many stakers problems, it doesn't directly solve the centralization problem.  There needs to be some way of reducing benefits when medallions are too close to one another; a sort of Coulomb's law that adds a benefit weighting to a medallion based on how isolated it is from other medallions.",No,"No, I want to skip to the last survey questions",,,,,,,,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,

Protocol-level issuance of LSTs. If you can't beat them, join them. 

Balancing the difficulty of staking and the risks being assumed. Some want staking to be 1-click, but I have persuaded myself this isn't a good idea because stakers need to be aware of the responsibilities they are taking on, and it can feel a little like they may not understand these risks with a 1-click staking solution. Maintaining a technical barrier to entry of some kind feels appropriate.

   These individuals tend to have an internalized and politicized negative opinion of people staking ETH/holding ETH and conceptualizing them as greedy whales.

- The total ETH supply inflation from more ETH staked is overrated as it is more than balanced out by EIP-1559 base fee burning.

- A reduction in issuance would favor centralized actors which is in opposition to the initial goal. The only change in the issuance curve I would support is one that is designed to be dynamic and FINAL (no changes ever after it).

So, the question that asked whether decreasing APR resulting in MEV making up a larger portion of rewards doesn't have an answer that is accurate for me. I earn a significant portion of my income from staking. I know my annual spend rate. My goal is for staking to bring in X% of my annual spend. APY is only one part of that equation. ETH price is the other part of that. So, a declining APY and an increasing ETH price could balance out and mean that I'm less inclined to stop staking. A declining APY and declining ETH price is going to put me into a position of having to discontinue staking. I do stake to support the network, but I expect the network to help support me in some capacity. I will accept a lower APY and lower fiat value of earnings to an extent to support the network. But if APY and ETH price can't help me meet my minimum requirements, I will necessarily have to stop staking and liquidate ETH."

If I want to participate what kind of hardware is needed?

This is still the case (I would also be helpless were it not for individuals on the Discord channel who are so helpful when anything goes wrong) but very little has changed in the bigger picture - It hasn't got any easier to run the nodes. And on balance I am not earning any more than I would by using one of the big centralised staking providers which is such a massive shame. I wanted to be a critical part of the network of home users powering the world computer but it has turned out the reality is nothing like that..

When something does go wrong on my validator and it stops validating for whatever reason (full disk, corrupt database, etc.) it is a nerve-wracking unpleasant experience. As I said before fortunately when this has happened there have been experts on the Discord channel who have managed to get me back on track but I feel this is purely down to their individual generosity so the risks for me are quite high. This is why I'm probably not going to be staking for much longer."

As a programmer, I can setup a node.  
But also as a programmer, I can't believe there's not a UI built to automatically install everything, automatically allow setup (and storage of keys so that they cannot be lost through accident). 

For instance, to setup a validator, you have to use a CLI tool, which only prints the key once.  You then need to ensure you copy this and save it locally so that you can move it off later.  

Then in teku, you need to create some json file of a base64 password and point teku to it.  I'm sure you get the point. 

If you want more adoption, this needs to be a single click, up and running type of thing with significant safe guards.  Yes, saving the private keys isn't good.  But its infinitely better to automate this with safety guards, so that initially, that private key cannot be lost accidentally.

This is literally causing many solo stakers to exit and chase the higher yields, which they cannot be faulted for as it's a very logical move to make.  The incentives to solo stake were strong at genesis, but have gotten weaker over time.  There needs to be some sort of new, strong financial incentive to not only bring solo stakers back, but also to retain them.  Otherwise this problem will just get worse.

That said, I still feel restaking is a cool, innovative technology and I'm not saying to shoot it down.  Similar deal with Pendle's fixed yields.  The Ethereum protocol has never been, and never should be, in the business of shutting down innovative ideas built on top of the network.  Instead strive for the ideal network state we would like to see via incentives.

Yes, the centralizing factors wrt LRTs/points are apparent - so let's somehow incentivize stakers who are not restaking, and issue much smaller rewards to those stakers whose underlying ETH is confirmed to be restaked.  I know all of that is probably easier said than done, but this is the kind of incentives-based system we should strive for."

In the US and other major jurisdictions, every incremental reward is regarded as regular income equivalent to its value in local currency. Some percentage of it is immediately taxable. rETH on the other hand is a single token that grows in value, and in the US is treated like capital gains, so tax is only due at time of sale potentially at a reduced rate. Solo stakers have a reduced compounded yield because a fraction of their rewards always need to be set aside for taxes. Also, if they aren't immediately selling that fraction and the ETH price drops substantially, they could be on the hook for more tax than the value of their ETH. A technical solution that provides solo stakers with a single token representing the value of their stake might be a straightforward way to deal with this.","Yes, familiar with the concept but have never participated in testnet or mainnet use cases","Yes, show me some DVT questions",To improve effectiveness / uptime in order to achieve maximum yield,1,Can guess,Can guess,Can guess,Can guess,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,"When staking change proposals have been discussed on ethresear.ch, it reads like the real experience of solo staking isn't being conveyed well to the developers.

Because the developer of Prysm clearly states that he is a Sikh, I think he has less motivation to do evil, so I chose Prysm. In fact, I don’t have enough money to buy a new hard drive if I switch to another solution, but I chose a higher cost.

Periodic airdrops are a good means, but they may face a worse situation in the decline phase when the bull market turns to the bear market, because the gains do not outweigh the losses. I think we can introduce some honest local node operators. ETH is one of the best donation media for churches, monasteries, mosques, temples, Taoist temples and shrines. If it promises to run nodes locally to maximize donation income and help the network, but entrusts the nodes to other entities for commissions, it will be a scandal (but this is a normal thing for other entities), but no one helps them practice."

I lost DAppnode UI access few times in the past because of technical issues, like router switch for example. I know there 4 ways to recover access, but installing Wireguard is not possible on my current Mac due to not being able to update to Mac version 15.x. Therefore I am bound to the Wifi access method. As I am not so familiar with the terminal, I feel nervous about maintaining access to DAppNode without having to switch to a new Mac, which I am hesitent about due to slashing risk. Advice would be nice....
Also:I lost access ro DAppNode Dscord and want to rejoin to be informed, but the invitation links do not work, even via the forum and DAppNode UI (do not offer a solution). Is that a problem on my end? Why can't I join via a Discord link?"
